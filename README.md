# Events App

A demo application created using Next.js

## Description

The application highlights some of the key benefits of the Next.js framework for React:

- Serverside rendering of static pages
- SEO improvements
- Simple server side code for minor backend uses
- Simplified page routing structure (instead of using react-router)

## Deployment

I have not deployed this demo application but it can be ran locally by cloning this repo and running `npm i` to install dependencies and `npm run dev` to start a development server.
